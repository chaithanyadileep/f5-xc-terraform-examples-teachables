==========================================================================

F5 and Nutanix:
***************
F5 and Nutanix are collaborating to deliver customers’ need on applications deployed on Nutanix Acropolis Hypervisor (AHV) and Nutanix Cloud Cluster (NC2) platform with robust security. F5 simplifies VMware Migration to Nutanix without compromising on application availability and security during the migration process. With F5 Distributed Cloud (F5 XC) integrating with Nutanix ensures seamless application connectivity across different infrastructure.
